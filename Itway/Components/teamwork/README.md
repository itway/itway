<a name="installation" />
## Installation

In order to install Laravel 5 Teamwork, just add 

    "mpociot/teamwork": "~1.0"

to your composer.json. Then run `composer install` or `composer update`.

(or run `composer require mpociot/teamwork` if you prefere that)

Then in your `config/app.php` add 

    Mpociot\Teamwork\TeamworkServiceProvider::class
    
in the `providers` array.
    
The `Teamwork` Facade will be installed automatically within the Service Provider.

<a name="configuration"/>
## Configuration

To publish Teamwork's configuration and migration files, run the `vendor:publish` command

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Mpociot\Teamwork\TeamworkServiceProvider"
```

This will create a `teamwork.php` in your config directory.
The default configuration should work just fine for you, but you can take a look at it, if you want to customize the table / model names Teamwork will use.

<a name="user-relation-to-team" />
### User relation to teams

Run the `migration` command, to generate all tables needed for Teamwork.


```bash
php artisan migrate
```
    
After the migration, 3 new tables will be created:

- teams &mdash; stores team records
- team_user &mdash; stores [many-to-many](http://laravel.com/docs/5.1/eloquent-relationships#many-to-many) relations between users and teams
- team_invites &mdash; stores pending invites for email addresses to teams

You will also notice that a new column `current_team_id` has been added to your users table. 
This column will define the Team, the user is currently assigned to.

<a name="models" />
### Models
    
<a name="team" />
#### Team

Create a Team model inside `app/Team.php` using the following example:

```php
<?php namespace App;

use Mpociot\Teamwork\TeamworkTeam;

class Team extends TeamworkTeam
{
}
```

The `Team` model has two main attributes:

- `owner_id` &mdash; Reference to the User model that owns this Team.
- `name` &mdash; Human readable name for the Team.

The `owner_id` is an optional attribute and is nullable in the database.

<a name="user" />
#### User

Add the `UserHasTeams` trait to your existing User model:

```php
<?php namespace App;

use Mpociot\Teamwork\Traits\UserHasTeams;

class User extends Model {

	use UserHasTeams; // Add this trait to your model
}
```

This will enable the relation with `Team` and add the following methods `teams()`, `ownedTeams()` `currentTeam()`, `invites()`, `isTeamOwner()`, `isOwnerOfTeam($team)`, `attachTeam($team)`, `detachTeam($team)`, `attachTeams($teams)`, `detachTeams($teams)`, `switchTeam($team)` within your `User` model.

Don't forget to dump composer autoload

```bash
composer dump-autoload
```

**And you are ready to go.**

<a name="usage" />
## Usage

<a name="basic-concepts" />
### Basic concepts

Let's start by creating two different Teams.

```php
$team	= new Team();
$team->owner_id = User::where('username', '=', 'sebastian')->first()->getKey();
$team->name = 'My awesome team';
$team->save();

$myOtherCompany = new Team();
$myOtherCompany->owner_id = User::where('username', '=', 'marcel')->first()->getKey();
$myOtherCompany->name = 'My other awesome team';
$myOtherCompany->save();
```

Now thanks to the `UserHasTeams` trait, assigning the Teams to the user is uber easy:

```php
$user = User::where('username', '=', 'sebastian')->first();

// team attach alias
$user->attachTeam($team); // parameter can be a Team object, array, or id

// or eloquent's original technique
$user->teams()->attach($team->id); // id only
```

By using the `attachTeam` method, if the User has no Teams assigned, the `current_team_id` column will automatically be set. 

<a name="know-my-teams" />
### Get to know my team(s)

The currently assigned Team of a user can be accessed through the `currentTeam` relation like this:

```php
echo "I'm currently in team: " . Auth::user()->currentTeam->name;
echo "The team owner is: " . Auth::user()->currentTeam->owner->username;

echo "I also have these teams: ";
print_r( Auth::user()->teams );

echo "I am the owner of these teams: ";
print_r( Auth::user()->ownedTeams );

echo "My team has " . Auth::user()->currentTeam->users->count() . " users.";
```

The `Team` model has access to these methods:

- `invites()` &mdash; Returns a many-to-many relation to associated invitations.
- `users()` &mdash; Returns a many-to-many relation with all users associated to this team.
- `owner()` &mdash; Returns a one-to-one relation with the User model that owns this team.
- `hasUser(User $user)` &mdash; Helper function to determine if a user is a teammember

<a name="team-owner" />
### Team owner

If you need to check if the User is a team owner (regardless of the current team) use the `isTeamOwner()` method on the User model.

```php
if( Auth::user()->isTeamOwner() )
{
	echo "I'm a team owner. Please let me pay more.";
}
```
Additionally if you need to check if the user is the owner of a specific team, use:

```php
$team = Auth::user()->currentTeam;
if( Auth::user()->isOwnerOfTeam( $team ) )
{
	echo "I'm a specific team owner. Please let me pay even more.";
}
```

The `isOwnerOfTeam` method also allows an array or id as team parameter.

<a name="switching-the-current-team" />
### Switching the current team

If your Users are members of multiple teams you might want to give them access to a `switch team` mechanic in some way. 

This means that the user has one "active" team, that is currently assigned to the user. All other teams still remain attached to the relation!

Glad we have the `UserHasTeams` trait.

```php
try {
	Auth::user()->switchTeam( $team_id );
	// Or remove a team association at all
	Auth::user()->switchTeam( null );
} catch( UserNotInTeamException $e )
{
	// Given team is not allowed for the user
}
```

Just like the `isOwnerOfTeam` method, `switchTeam` accepts a Team object, array, id or null as a parameter.

<a name="inviting-others" />
### Inviting others

The best team is of no avail if you're the only team member.

To invite other users to your teams, use the `Teamwork` facade.

```php
Teamwork::inviteToTeam( $email, $team, function( $invite )
{
	// Send email to user / let them know that they got invited
});
```

You can also send invites by providing an object with an `email` property like:

```php
$user = Auth::user();

Teamwork::inviteToTeam( $user , $team, function( $invite )
{
	// Send email to user / let them know that they got invited
});
```


This method will create a `TeamworkInvite` model and return it in the callable third parameter.

This model has these attributes:

- `email` &mdash;  The email that was invited.
- `accept_token` &mdash; Unique token used to accept the invite.
- `deny_token` &mdash; Unique token used to deny the invite.

In addition to these attributes, the model has these relations:

- `user()` &mdash; one-to-one relation using the `email` as a unique identifier on the User model.
- `team()` &mdash; one-to-one relation return the Team, that invite was aiming for.

**Note:**
The `inviteToTeam` method will **not** check if the given email already has a pending invite. To check for pending invites use the `hasPendingInvite` method on the `Teamwork` facade.

Example usage:

```php
if( !Teamwork::hasPendingInvite( $request->email, $request->team) )
{
	Teamwork::inviteToTeam( $request->email, $request->team, function( $invite )
	{
                // Send email to user
	});
} else {
	// Return error - user already invited
}
```

<a name="accepting-invites" />
### Accepting invites

Once you invited other users to join your team, in order to accept the invitation use the `Teamwork` facade once again.

```php
$invite = Teamwork::getInviteFromAcceptToken( $request->token ); // Returns a TeamworkInvite model or null

if( $invite ) // valid token found
{
	Teamwork::acceptInvite( $invite );
}
```

The `acceptInvite` method does two thing:

- Call `attachTeam` with the invite-team on the currently authenticated user.
- Delete the invitation afterwards.

<a name="denying-invites" />
### Denying invites

Just like accepting invites:

```php
$invite = Teamwork::getInviteFromDenyToken( $request->token ); // Returns a TeamworkInvite model or null

if( $invite ) // valid token found
{
	Teamwork::denyInvite( $invite );
}
```

The `denyInvite` method is only responsible for deleting the invitation from the database.
